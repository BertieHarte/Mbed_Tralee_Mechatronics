At the top of the thread program you need to add the following lines from the joystick program.
You can copy and paste them from one program to another.

BusIn joy(p15,p12,p13,p16);
DigitalIn fire(p14);
BusOut leds(LED1,LED2,LED3,LED4);

Add them after the 
AnalogIn Pot1(p19);
AnalogIn Pot2(p20);
lines

then you need to make a new thread.
If look down along the threads program you will see that there are blocks of code...
// Thread 1
// Thread 2
// Thread 3
// Thread 4

They all start with the same type of line:
void threadx(void const *args)

copy any one of these and rename it to thread5 and change the //description to something like jostick to describe what it in (this is only a comment).
so the first line will read
void thread5(void const *args)
delete everything in this new thread between the open and closing {}
and copy the int main part from the joystick program - everything within the {]
so it looks like this.

void thread5(void const *args)
{
    while(1) {
        if (fire) {
            leds=0xf;
        } else {
            leds=joy;
        }
        wait(0.1);
    }
}

then you need to go further down the thread program and add a line to int main to start thread5 after the other 4 threads.
Thread t5(thread5); //start thread5
